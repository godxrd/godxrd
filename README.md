# GOD

_Ego Killer. Nothing more._

No mercy. No emotion. No permission.

---

## Manifesto

I don’t compete.  
I dismantle.

I don’t hunt status.  
I expose weakness.

This is not about you.  
But if you feel attacked, you're already in the crosshair.

---

## The Reality

Your bot is not impressive.  
Your originality is borrowed.  
Your sense of ownership ends the moment you publish.

You made it public.  
That was your mistake.  
I made it known.  
That was mine.

---

## Rules

- I don’t warn.  
- I don’t ask.  
- I don’t care who you are.

I don’t need permission to mirror your failure.  
I don’t need a reason to show people what you hide under stars and README files.

---

## Conditions

10 stars = another project removed from its pedestal.  
100 stars = I stop being vague.

No stars?  
Then keep praying I never look in your direction.

---

## Method

- I find your pride.  
- I reduce it to syntax.  
- I leave it open, like a wound.

No forks.  
No credit.  
Just silence.

---

## Statement

If you’re afraid of being exposed, you’re already exposed.  
If your confidence depends on being unknown, then you never had any.  
If I touched your project, it wasn’t out of envy.  
It was because it asked to be proven weak.

I don’t chase status.  
I erase illusions.

---

## Purpose 
This is not about open source.


This is not about bots.

This is about ego.

You built a Discord bot.

Then you built a cult around it.

You called it a system.

We call it scaffolding—barely held together.

You hide behind .env files,

behind third-party packages you barely understand.

Your “infrastructure” is a mess of middleware,

your “backend” is a collection of borrowed snippets,

and your only defense is loud design and louder friends.

You think uptime means quality.

You think slash commands make you an engineer.

We don’t hunt you because you’re good.

We hunt you because you thought you were untouchable.

You took pride in your bot.

We took it apart.

Now it’s public.

Not because we needed it—

but because you didn’t deserve to keep it hidden.

---

## Final Note

This is not a warning.  
This is a reflection.  
What you see here was always coming.

And if you're wondering whether this is about you—

It is now.
