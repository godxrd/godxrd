# GOD: THE OBLIVION PROTOCOL

Ego Killer. Your Annihilation, Delivered.

No mercy. No emotion. No permission. Just the cold, surgical precision of absolute demolition.

---

## Manifesto

I don’t compete.
I dismantle.

I don’t hunt status.
I expose weakness. Ruthlessly.

This is not about you.
But if you feel attacked, you're not just in the crosshair—you're already bleeding out.
The Reality

Your bot is not impressive. It's a digital abomination.
Your originality is borrowed. It's stolen, poorly.
Your sense of ownership ends the moment you publish. You sign its death warrant.

You made it public.
That was your terminal mistake.
I made it known.
That was my inevitable judgment.

---

## Rules

    I don’t warn.
    I don’t ask.
    I don’t care who you are.

I don’t need permission to mirror your catastrophic failure.
I don’t need a reason to rip back the curtain and show people what pathetic, rotting code you hide under stars and README files.
Method

    I find your pride.
    I reduce it to putrid syntax.
    I leave it gaping, like a gangrenous wound.

No forks.
No credit.
Just the deafening, absolute silence of your digital grave.
Statement

If you’re afraid of being exposed, you’re not just exposed—you're already flayed alive.
If your confidence depends on being unknown, then you never had any; you merely clung to a fragile delusion.
If I touched your project, it wasn’t out of envy.
It was because it begged to be proven weak, to have its inherent worthlessness validated by demolition.

I don’t chase status.
I incinerate illusions.

---

## Purpose

This is not about open source.
This is not about bots.
This is about the grotesque, festering tumor of your ego.

You built a Discord bot.
Then you built a cult around its putrid core.

You called it a system.
We call it rotting scaffolding—barely held together by duct tape and delusion.

You hide behind .env files, as if that flimsy shield could protect you. Some of you are so breathtakingly incompetent, you can't even get that right. You expose your entire pathetic existence because you're too stupid to manage a basic configuration file. You hide behind third-party packages you barely understand, blindly copying from Stack Overflow without a flicker of comprehension.

Your “infrastructure” is a mess of middleware, a cesspool of borrowed, ill-fitting components. Your “backend” is a collection of borrowed snippets, each one a desperate whisper of your own inadequacy. And your only defense is loud design and louder, equally misguided friends.

You think uptime means quality. You think slash commands make you an engineer. You are neither.

We don't hunt you because you’re good. We hunt you because you thought you were untouchable. Because you dared to believe you were anything more than a fleeting mistake.

You took pride in your bot.
We took immense pleasure in ripping it apart.
Now it’s public.

Not because we needed it—we only deal in destruction—but because you never deserved a single moment of hidden pride.

## Final Note

This is not a warning.
This is a sentence.
What you see here was always coming. It was always the inevitable consequence of your hubris.

And if you're wondering whether this is about you—

It is now. And there is no escape.

And if you're wondering whether this is about you—

It is now.
