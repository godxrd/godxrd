# GOD

Ego Killer.  
No mercy. No emotion. No permission.

---

## Manifesto

I don’t compete.  
I dismantle.

I don’t hunt status.  
I expose weakness.

This is not about you.  
But if you feel attacked, you're already in the crosshair.

---

## The Reality

Your bot is not impressive.  
Your originality is borrowed.  
Your sense of ownership ends the moment you publish.

You made it public.  
That was your mistake.  
I made it known.  
That was mine.

---

## Rules

- I don’t warn.  
- I don’t ask.  
- I don’t care who you are.

I don’t need permission to mirror your failure.  
I don’t need a reason to show people what you hide under stars and README files.

---

## Conditions

10 stars = another project removed from its pedestal.  
100 stars = I stop being vague.

No stars?  
Then keep praying I never look in your direction.

---

## Method

- I find your pride.  
- I reduce it to syntax.  
- I leave it open, like a wound.

No forks.  
No credit.  
Just silence.

---

## Statement

If you’re afraid of being exposed, you’re already exposed.  
If your confidence depends on being unknown, then you never had any.  
If I touched your project, it wasn’t out of envy.  
It was because it asked to be proven weak.

I don’t chase status.  
I erase illusions.

---

## Final Note

This is not a warning.  
This is a reflection.  
What you see here was always coming.

And if you're wondering whether this is about you—

It is now.
