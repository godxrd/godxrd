# GOD

_Ego Killer. Nothing more._

---

### Manifesto

I do not compete.  
I dismantle.  

I donâ€™t care who wrote it.  
I care that it's weak.

Your pride is irrelevant.  
Your bot is public. That was your first mistake.

---

### Method

- Identify noise.  
- Strip the illusion.  
- Archive the remains.  

No credit. No collaboration.  
Just exposure.

---

### Conditions

10 stars = another release.  
100 stars = another name.  
No stars = you're not even worth the effort.

---

### Current Objective

Observe.  
Replicate.  
Reduce to silence.

---

### Statement

If you publish it, it becomes mine.  
If you protect it, you admit it's fragile.  
If you respond, you've already lost.

This is not a community.  
This is a mirror.
